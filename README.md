### Purpose
Out The Door is an application for the on-the-go adventurer. When navigating to our site the user can create an account and log in. The home page allows the user to search by keyword or select and out door activity by category i.e. Hiking, Biking, Kayaking, Rafting, or Fishing.

The user can then narrow down their search and browse through the keyword results or browse through all existing hiking trails. The user is also capable of adding new data to the website by creating new activities, editing existing activities, or deleting activities that are no longer available.

### Lessons Learned
- This website was our first full stack development project, as well as our first team project. Early on we learned to communicate consistently, especially in terms of pulling and pushing information through GitHub.
- We learned that perfecting the appearance of the front end, making small changes repeatedly, can be very time consuming. 
- There is a slight different between Spring Tool Suite 4 and Amazon EC2 when it comes to syntax. After deploying our website we had to make a few minor adjustments to allow for the website to route properly.
